# SECFilingClassifier
Experiments with ML models to classify SEC filings

Look in experiments.ipynb to see how this classifier was created using Keras and Tensorflow.  If you want to go beyond looking at the code and want to run this yourself, for now, you'll need to install tensorflow, Keras, and Jupyter Notebook on your system. When I get time, I will include a script to set up a virtual environment automatically that you can run this in.
